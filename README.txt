Soashable OSW is a web application which builds on the OneSocialWeb initiative, 
using jQuery and StropheJS libraries. The primary motivations for its creation 
are:

 - Create a new version of the Soashable client that is not bound by the GPL, as
   as the previous version is.

 - Give an alternative to the official OSW web application, which is written in 
   GWT, to people who would prefer not to use that tool.

 - Provide a second implementation of OSW standards to help ensure they are 
   generic enough to be implemented on multiple platforms.


Note that this software is provided as-is under the MIT license. Since this is 
is just a playground at this point, things are bound to break. Please feel free
to fork at any time and push some changes back if you think something I am 
doing could be better, rather than bug me about it :)

Happy Hacking.
